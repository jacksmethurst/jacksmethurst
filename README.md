So, who am I? and why should you care? ✌️

Well, I'm a BA Honours, First Class graduate in Graphic Design, with multiple software certifications from Adobe & Google. I also have multiple years experience in both Web & Print Industries.

I live by the mantra "You can always learn more", and take this in a very literal sense. Pushing myself to learn new tools to add to the toolbelt. Like, for example, how I am self taught and versed in Web Design.
